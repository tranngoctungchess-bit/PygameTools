Kernel : This component serves as a foundation upon which to build another component;
         therefore, its features are not exclusive to other templates or components.
Templates : As it is the primary tool reaching the user, it must possess the following characteristics:
            -Its tools (class) don't necessarily have to be lightweight, but they shouldn't have too many parameters.
            -It must be backward compatible with Pygame.
            -It shouldn't be separated from pygame; everything must be built in such a way that pygame can run it properly.
