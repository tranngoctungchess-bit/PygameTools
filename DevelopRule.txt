Kernel: This component serves as a foundation upon which to build another component.
         Therefore, its features are not exclusive to other templates or components.
Templates: As it is the primary tool reaching the user, it must possess the following characteristics:
            1. Its tools (class) don't necessarily have to be lightweight, but they shouldn't have too many parameters.
            2.It must be backward compatible with Pygame.
            3.It shouldn't be separated from pygame; everything must be built in such a way that pygame can run it properly.
            4. You should import the kernel when creating templates, as it acts as both the kernel and the automatic init function.
            5. Alternatively, if you don't want to import the kernel, you can create your own automatic init function (not recommended).
            6. Your template may have a more advanced version, but please consider the need.
            7. Advanced templates should be separate modules when they introduce significantly new functionality
            8. You need an .md file once you've finished developing a template. That .md file introduces the template or provides more information.
mdFile: This is the structure of the md file in the original template(Not the custom template)
