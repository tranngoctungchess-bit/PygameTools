The Note for Templates developer and Users
0.01:
-This was the first version of the project, then called PygameTools.
-In the kernel, Margin was included, and an SFM template was added to create smart screens with integrated Margin.
-About MarginScreen: MarginScreenReadme.md
-In the kernel's margin class, there are basic functions like get_pos, save_margin, and check_anchor_valid.

-get_pos: Gets the width, height, and anchor values of an object, then calculates the object's position and returns the pos.
-The other two functions are as their names suggest.
0.02:
- Added class LayoutHelper (formerly Next) in kernel, which provides:
    • get_pos(obj_rect, next_obj_size, direction, padding): calculates position next to an existing object (Up/Down/Left/Right).
    • check_enough_size(): validates if there is enough screen space for placement.

- Improved Margin class:
    • Added update_on_resize(screen): updates padding and recalculates margins when screen is resized.
    • Added content_rect property: returns pygame.Rect of the inner content area (inside margins).
    • Optimized caching: positions are now cached per object size and anchor; cache clears on resize.
    • Added anchor validation via list of supported anchors.

- New templates:
    • VerticalStack: automatically stacks objects vertically (Down or Up with reverse=True).
    • HorizontalStack: automatically stacks objects horizontally (Right or Left with reverse=True).
    • Both stacks support padding (can be negative for overlap), include total_length property, clear(), pop(), and __len__().

- Kernel initialization is now automatic via kernal_Init (no need to call pygame.init() manually when using templates).
-SFM renamed to MarginScreen
0.03:
- Optimized kernel performance (Margin, LayoutHelper) – now only 1.1–1.3× slower than equivalent manual code.
- Added SunLayout template – places objects in a 3×3 grid around a central object.
- Updated DeveloperRule.txt with guidelines for template documentation and advanced versions.
