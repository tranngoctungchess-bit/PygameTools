SFM: Screen For Margin 1.0
A modular UI Layout Framework for Pygame.

SFM (Screen For Margin) bridge the gap between Pygame's freedom and the structured layout needs of modern Game UI. It provides an intuitive, anchor-based positioning system that eliminates manual coordinate calculations.

Core Philosophy
Zero Logic Bloat: Clean, minimal code that gets out of your way.

Modular Scaffolding: Import only the templates you need, or clone them directly into your project.

Responsive by Design: Built-in padding and percentage-based margins.
📐 Supported Anchors
SFM uses a 9-Grid System for absolute precision:

Top_Left, Top_Center, Top_Right

Center_Left, Center, Center_Right

Bottom_Left, Bottom_Center, Bottom_Right
